## 📖 Project Overview

**Advanced R-Type** is a networked video game project inspired by the classic **R-Type**, reimagined as a multiplayer game where 1-4 players battle the evil Bydos together. This project involves creating:
- A **multithreaded server** that handles game logic and communication.
- A **graphical client** to display the game and handle player input.

The project emphasizes advanced software engineering practices, including modularity, cross-platform support, and efficient networking.
